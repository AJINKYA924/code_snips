# Code_snips
 - A collection of helpful code snippets I have made that can be used for larger programs. (This is for HacktoberFest2021)
 
 - Open for users to contribute to the codebase so as to help each other out. Algorithms,Object detection algorithms,machine learning algorithms to basic templates and short codes to allow for creation of web-page elements this codebase welcomes all and I hope that others will see the use of such a repository.
 - The plan is to have helpful snippets of code which others can contribute to as well pull in order to improve their codes:
  1. This code_snips can be used for training models in githib copilot
  2. The centering of webpages as well as background settings as well animations for web dev
  3. Models for AI/ML repositories
  4. Helpful Python scripts whoch can be conjoined with main codes to accomplish a task.
  5. You can directly put pull requests than raising an issue.
 
 


 - If you wish to contribute several code files related to one another please do put these codes into a zip file.
